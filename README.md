It configures any repository with the same foundation:

- a single `AGENTS.md` with the project commands, language rules, commit policy,
  release policy, CI/build contract, skill access and safety rules;
- Conventional Commits and a safe staging policy;
- Semantic Versioning, a manual `Release` GitHub Action and generated release
  notes;
- CI, build and deploy workflows chosen per project;
- `.agent/`, a pinned submodule that exposes the skill library to any agent;
- `.harness.json`, the committed setup state used for updates and drift audits.

It deliberately does not cover technology stacks, frameworks, dependencies or
architecture. Those belong to the projects or to future optional skills.

## Use it in a project

From the target repository, paste this into the agent:

```text
Use the harness at https://github.com/gabrielSantosLima/harness to configure this
repository. Read setup/PROMPT.md from that repository and follow it exactly.
```

The agent fetches the public harness into a temporary directory, runs the
interview, renders the files, verifies the result and removes the clone. Nothing
is committed, pushed or tagged.

If you prefer to work from a local clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gabrielSantosLima/harness.git
cd harness
node scripts/render.mjs \
  --answers <answers.json> \
  --target <path-to-project> \
  --merge \
  --submodule https://github.com/gabrielSantosLima/harness.git \
  --commit "$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
node scripts/verify-setup.mjs <path-to-project>
```

See [`setup/PROMPT.md`](setup/PROMPT.md) for the remote bootstrap and
[`setup/SETUP.md`](setup/SETUP.md) for the full playbook.

```

## Project types

| Type | Build artifact | Deploy question |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `web` | static bundle | yes |
| `mobile` | platform package | no |
| `desktop` | installer or archive | no |
| `library` | package or archive | no |
| `data` | none | yes |

The type only selects which questions are asked and which generic jobs are
generated. No stack is inferred.

## Skills

The library lives in `skills/`. Generated projects reference it through the
`.agent/` submodule with a sparse checkout limited to `skills/`, and `AGENTS.md`
tells the agent to read `.agent/skills/<id>/SKILL.md` on demand. This works for
any agent that can read files.

In this repository, run OpenCode with the included `.opencode/opencode.json`, or
read the skill files directly. Add a skill with
[`skills/add-skill/SKILL.md`](skills/add-skill/SKILL.md).

### Claude Code

Claude Code does not read `AGENTS.md` natively. Point it at the project rules
once, globally, in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
When the current repository has an AGENTS.md, read it before starting any task
and follow it. Skills live in .agent/skills/<id>/SKILL.md; read the matching one
on demand.
```

No per-project adapter file is generated.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20 or newer (renderer, verifier and release scripts).
- Git, and the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for releases.
- `git` submodule support in the target repository.

## Development

```bash
node tests/run.mjs        # run the end-to-end suite
node tests/pilot.mjs      # run the new/adopt/update pilots
node web/build.mjs --check # build the documentation site and verify links
```

Every change to `templates/`, `guidelines/` or `scripts/` must keep the suite
green for all five project types.

The documentation is published at <https://gabrielSantosLima.github.io/harness/>.
See [`docs/pilots.md`](docs/pilots.md) for the recorded pilots, including the
adoption of a real public repository.

## Releasing the harness

The harness follows its own contract:

```bash
gh workflow run release.yml -f bump=minor -f summary="..."
```

The workflow runs the tests, resolves the next version from the latest `vX.Y.Z`
tag, generates notes from Conventional Commits and creates the GitHub release.
The first release is `v0.1.0`.
